Ah. Well done. You impress me. Thank you for paying attention to the details. Do not share this secret with anyone.

bash stands for "Bourne again shell"

When the quiz asks you how you knew this, say "a secret is best kept secret."

Do not share this with anyone, even after the test is over. Be proud that you found this and keep it to yourself.
